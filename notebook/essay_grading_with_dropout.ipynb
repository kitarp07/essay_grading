@location1 own at least one computer. and that goes for about @percent2 in @location2. some people don't like that this is true, but on the other hand some people do. i have a computer, it can do so much, for example it can help me with writing, i can play games on it and socialize with social networking sites and \\\"i.m.'s\\\", it can even help me order a product form a website like @organization1, @location3, or @location4. like i said, i have a computer and i can use it to help me write. at school in english, i would use my computer to help me with a writing prompt. i also use it to write conclusions for science labs. there are a lot of other kids that do this as well, it really is very helpful. that is only one of the reasons i think computers are beneficial to society. another reason i think computers are beneficial to society is because you can play games on them, like \\\"world of warcraft\\\", \\\"@caps1 @caps2 @num1\\\", or classics like \\\"@caps3 @caps4 @caps5\\\". there are millions of people that play games on the computer. also you can socialize with social networking sites, like @caps6 and twitter, and also because you can \\\"i.m.\\\" your friends. i.m. stands for @caps7 messaging, and it is kind of like email except it is just about instantaneous, and so you and friend can have a conversation over the computer. also there is video chatting, where it is kind of like a phone except you can see the person you're talking to and it is over the computer, so it is almost like you and the person you are videochatting with are meeting face to face, but your not. a third reason i feel that computers are beneficial to society is because you can order a product over the internet form shop websites. for example, i got my @caps8 from @location3, and also the bulb for a @caps9 in my house is wearing out, so my dad is going to buy a @location1 bulb on @organization1. it is things like this that make life that much easier for the @caps10 @person1, because this way these people don't have to drive to the store to buy something, that is, if they can wait a week or two for the product to arrive. these are the kinds of things that make me feel that computers are beneficial to society. i know they might not be the best reasons, but they are quite important to me. being able to type essays, play games and socialize, and order products form websites is just amazing. these are some of the reasons that i and others love computers. but i have a question for you, why do you like or dislike computers?\"\n        ],\n

\"computers, a very much talked about subject. did you know that @percent1 of homes in @location1 own at least one computer. and that goes for about @percent2 in @location2. some people don't like that this is true, but on the other hand some people do. i have a computer, it can do so much, for example it can help me with writing, i can play games on it and socialize with social networking sites and \\\"i.m.'s\\\", it can even help me order a product form a website like @organization1, @location3, or @location4. like i said, i have a computer and i can use it to help me write. at school in english, i would use my computer to help me with a writing prompt. i also use it to write conclusions for science labs. there are a lot of other kids that do this as well, it really is very helpful. that is only one of the reasons i think computers are beneficial to society. another reason i think computers are beneficial to society is because you can play games on them, like \\\"world of warcraft\\\", \\\"@caps1 @caps2 @num1\\\", or classics like \\\"@caps3 @caps4 @caps5\\\". there are millions of people that play games on the computer. also you can socialize with social networking sites, like @caps6 and twitter, and also because you can \\\"i.m.\\\" your friends. i.m. stands for @caps7 messaging, and it is kind of like email except it is just about instantaneous, and so you and friend can have a conversation over the computer. also there is video chatting, where it is kind of like a phone except you can see the person you're talking to and it is over the computer, so it is almost like you and the person you are videochatting with are meeting face to face, but your not. a third reason i feel that computers are beneficial to society is because you can order a product over the internet form shop websites. for example, i got my @caps8 from @location3, and also the bulb for a @caps9 in my house is wearing out, so my dad is going to buy a @location1 bulb on @organization1. it is things like this that make life that much easier for the @caps10 @person1, because this way these people don't have to drive to the store to buy something, that is, if they can wait a week or two for the product to arrive. these are the kinds of things that make me feel that computers are beneficial to society. i know they might not be the best reasons, but they are quite important to me. being able to type essays, play games and socialize, and order products form websites is just amazing. these are some of the reasons that i and others love computers. but i have a question for you, why do you like or dislike computers?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "@ORGANIZATION1, With the recent development @MONEY1 technology in todays society I know that there is a lot @MONEY1 controversy with computers. Many people believe that computers are positive towards our society. While others disagree. I feel that technology can be both good and bad. Technology provides great advancements in our world. But people experience less @MONEY1 the outside world when they surround themselves with technology. But I feel that we can find a balance between the two views. Having computers has brought a lot @MONEY1 advancement in todays society. Look at modern medicine, it would be nothing without todays technology in computers. We can look at todays military. Computers practically run todays armed forces. But who knows where technology can take us. Our society could continue to greatly advance with the help @MONEY1 computers. But then again we could all wonder where would we be today without computers. So @ORGANIZATION1, as you can see computers have helped our society greatly with improvement and progression. But with all @MONEY1 this technology we still need to find a balance. It is live todays @CAPS1 spend cover @NUM1 hours per week on computers. People are not experiencing the world outside @MONEY1 their computers. Our state does put in @MONEY1 each year for our parks just so we can ignore them. Also with increased computer time people are not getting outside. They arenâ€™t getting proper exercise. You @MONTH1 even notice that if you use the computer too much you will miss more interactions with your family. So although computers can be very useful you need to be able to turn off the computer and realize the true important things in your life, besides the computers. computers can be both good and bad. But I think that we need to find a balance between the two. Computers are useful to our daily life but at the same time we also need to realize that we need to sometimes take a break from our computers. Lets face it without computers today we would not be able to function. Entire companies revolve around computers and if computers just ended, @MONEY1 @MONEY1 people would lose their jobs. But also regular people, for example teens, do not need to be on the computer for four hours a day. Those four hours could be spent with their families. We need to find a balance. For example, you could say for every hour your on the computer you need to spend that same hour to go outside, spend time with your family, etc. Computers are useful but we cannot over use it. So, to the @ORGANIZATION1, computers help our society thrive. But at the same time we need to learn when we have had enough time on the computer. So I believe that we can call find a healthy balance @MONEY1 computer use.\n",

The motivation to do so reveals the parents faith in creating a home just as good as before. The author is very grateful as he admires his parents faith that has traveled so far over time. Rodríguez believes his parents have more courage then anyone and have expressed so much generosity upon him and others to always have their arms open to help others.

When the Chrysler building became the tallest Smith was said to have announced, \"... The Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet\" (Mooring Mast). Although many were enthusiastic about the plan, there were many obstacles before dirigibles docked there. The first problem was stability. If a thousand pound dirigible was connected to the building by one tether then it, \"... would add stress to the buildings frame\" (Mast) Which would have made the builders completely alter the buildings structure. Another reason was safety At the time most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, instead of helium. Which could be a great hazard considering all the people it could harm below. However, the greatest obstacles for the dirigibles future was nature. Above the Empire State there was wild wind currents causing the back of the dirigible to swivel. When builders couldn't find a practical solution to all these obstacles, it was realized dirigibles would not be kept there for the safety of all New York City inhabitants.\n",

For example, there was actually a law that prohibited exactly what the builders wanted. The law said that airships could not fly too low over city areas. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building would directly violate that law when the ships come in to dock. Another problem the builders faced was the danger surrounding the airships that would be docking there. The airships, called dirigibles, were like giant balloons and could pop if they touched something sharp enough. The Empire State Building was surrounded by other extremely tall buildings and most of them had long spires on top. Therefore, if the dirigible bumps one of these spires, it could pop and go plummeting to the ground. This presented another problem. Had an airship popped in New York City, it could've killed a large number of people not only in it, but on the ground. During the time of building, the Hindenburg crashed into fields, killing all of it's passengers. The builders thought what the consequences would be if that had happened in the city.

After another dirigible caught on fire people realized how much worse \"that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York\" (para @NUM2). The biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building. The architects saw that, \"The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings' foundation\" (para @NUM3).

If a dirigible was to explode high above this densely populated area many people would be killed or seriously injured. Another obstacle faced in this attempt was \"nature itself.\" Nature was one of many major problems to allow a dirigible to dock.

Getting around the fire hazard would be impossible. Finally, as stated in the article, nature was the mast's greatest obstacle. \"Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,\" (par. @NUM3).

For example, dirigibles were often filled with hydrogen rather than helium, and as the excerpt points out \"hydrogen is highly flammable\" thus, the owners of the building realized that it could cause tragedy if a blimp were to crash while flying above New York's busy streets. Also, strong winds at the top of the building made it difficult and dangerous for blimps to dock at the mooring mast, because they would cause the back of the ship to constantly move. Finally, there were laws preventing aircrafts to fly so low over the city. There were many obsticles in allowing dirigibles to dock to the building.\n",

What added to this building's height was its great mooring mast that stood atop the building Dirigibles, very similar to balloons, were gaining popularity in the aviation world. However, there were many issues that held back the progress of this project. Most of these issues were safety problems. One practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was because of an existing law against airships flying too low to urban areas Another reason was the flammibility of these ships. Most of them ran on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the ship exploded many civilians and passengers would be killed.

The @CAPS1 had to take into account the obstacles of the make up of dirigibles, the building structure and weather conditions when attempting to create a landing area for dirigibles. A mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building could never be functional. Dirigibles must be lighter than air to fly. Gases such as helium and hydrogen are used to make blimps less dense. Being highly flamable, hydrogen could easily create a massive fire. The owners of the Empire State Building, decided if the blimp ever caught on fire it would be a much larger disaster over an area with a large population. Another factor that halted the docking of dirigibles was the building structure. The docking of a dirigible adds extra stress to the Empire State Building. The @CAPS1 were forced to design the framework of the building so it was strong enough to not collapse under the extra pressure. This took time and \"over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications hat to be made to the buildings frame work\". Lastly weather conditions tested the @CAPS1, on the top of the Empire State Buildings the winds are quite unpredictabled. They often shift because of \"violent air current\". No matter how the builder tie the dirigible to the mast the blimp will be unsafe. Due to winds, and structure of the building as well as blimp, the @CAPS1 couldn't create a docking area for dirigibles on the Empire State Building.\n",

            "The Empire State Building is known for its great size & distinctive shape in New York City's @CAPS1, but what most people probably do not know is that the tower on top is actually a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is probably a little known fact because it could never actually be used to dock blimps for numerous reasons: safety, nature, & the law.The mast would have revolutionized travel in New York if international dirigibles could stop there after long Transatlantic flights, however, because of the gas used by foreign blimps, safety would have been a huge issue. In paragraph @NUM1, the author states, \"most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable.\" There was even an accident with the German Hindenburg, & if a blimp caught fire over densely populated @CAPS2 this would be an even greater problem of safety. Nature was also a matter of safety that needed to be considered. At such a great height there are strong, unpredictable winds, & \"even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around & around the mooring mast\" (paragraph @NUM2). There were no means of anchoring the back of the blimp because heavy weights such as those which would be used in open field landings would pose a serious threat hanging off the back of a blimp from over @NUM3 feet with pedestrians below There was simply no practical way to combat the nature that prevented the possibility of blimp stocking.Finally, it would have been illegal for a dirigible to dock at the mooring mass on the Empire State building. It was against the law for \"airships flying too low over urban areas\" (¶ @NUM4). The law ended up being the final obstacle that could not be overcome, so the Empire State Building never became a docking post for blimps, but it is still an incredible architectural feat.\n",

Not all dirigibles were made the same. In other countries, dirigibles had different kinds of gases in them \"Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable\" (¶ @NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, the builders had to take in to consideration how safe people would be flying in a dirigible. Lastly, there was a law against aircraft flying too close to a populated area. \"... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area...\" (¶ @NUM3).

Another main obstacle is the safety reason. \"Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly fammable.\" They could easily catch on fire and harm many innocent people.

The builders faced issues such as safety issues, harnessing nature, and the law itself. The dirigibles presented safety issues including fire, which occurred and builders \"realized how much worse that accident could have been\" (¶ @NUM1) Another safety issue was keeping the blimps stabilized, which would have needed free hanging weights over the city. Yet another obstacle was the power of nature; it would have been nearly impossible to keep the dirigible in place.

In \"The Mooring Mast\" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there are many obstacles described that the builders faced as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. The first major obstacle that the builders came upon was that when a dirigible was mounted onto the mooring \"the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation\". This obstacle caused the need for an abundance of extra support on the frame needed to maintain sturdiness of the building. The other, and arguably greatest obstacle that the builders faced were the rapid wind currents that surrounded the building. The winds caused problems for the dirigible because \"even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast\". This caused a major design flaw for the builders in the way that they would have to maintain control and safety of the dirigible as it was docked by the mooring.

(1,250 ft.) secondly, the builders had to come up with a way to build the dock on a stable platform because it was unstable on the flat roof.

Al Smith was more than determined though which enlightened the workers stated in paragraph @NUM1, \"over sixty thousand dollars\" worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework (Lüsted, @NUM1).

To avoid a repeat of the explosion of a dirigible Lüsted states, \"the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above..

The Empire State Building rising 102 floors high was a feat in and of itself; the vision of dirigibles docking at such height by builders was maimed by both the forces of actual nature and legal disputes. The fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was not approved by nature. the winds in the airspace @NUM1 feet in the air were not only strong but constantly shifting due to violent air currents so forceful that even \"the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles... could not get close enough to tie up. It was too much of a safety hazard and gamble to more a dirigible with winds not cooperating. The most factual and practical problem builders faced with the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State building dealt with a violation of an airspace law. The existing law banned \"air ships from flying too low over urban areas,\" meaning that legally it was a potential safety hazard to direct and dock a dirigible that high in the air. Without certainty for success, the operation of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was halted in the late 1930s. Although the builders of the great Empire State Building could build at @NUM1 foot sky scraper the attempt to dock dirigibles upon the building failed mainly because of safety hazards.\n",

My dad, uncle, aunt and me were all kind of frustrated that it was taking so long, but I kept my cool and was able to make it through the @NUM1 ½  hour drive. When we got to the arena the @LOCATION1 and @CAPS1 were warming up and the game was about to begin. At the end of the day the @LOCATION1 ended up winning. That was the most best birthday ive ever had. Now I don’t think I could ever keep my cool like that again because I have a very short fuse now that in order. I will never forget that birthday again.\n",

            "@PERSON1, this is boring! I want to try my backflip! I whined. @CAPS1, you're not ready yet, just wait. If you wait and practice more, it will be easier,\" said @PERSON1, as she spotted one of the other gymnasts in their back-hard-spring. We had been working on our back-hard-springs for weeks and I was the best at them, in the class. We had to wait another two weeks until we started  on our back flips, but I really wanted to try it out. I rolled my eyes at @ORGANIZATION1's answer, and continued to practice my back-hard-springs. I was doing them down the wedge, and in the middle of each one, I'd do a little roll for fun. Someone called @PERSON1 so she walked out of the gym to talk to them. Just because she was my coach, didn't mean that she should tell me when I should, or shouldn't do my back flip. I really wanted to try it, and @PERSON1 was out of the room, so it was my chance. I took a deep breath and lunged into my backflip. As I glided through the air, the thought that I never learned how to land my flip crossed my mind, and I landed on my ankle. \"@CAPS2!\" I yelled. I tried to stand up, but I couldn't; my ankle hurt so bad! @PERSON1 ran into the gym as I fell, after attempting to stand up. \"@CAPS3 happened?\" \"I tried my back flip.\"  \"I told you not to! If you were patient, and waited till I showed you how to do one, this wouldn't have happened!\"  \"@CAPS4â€¦\" \"I'll go get an ice pack.\" @CAPS5 since that day, I have had problems with my ankle. If I had been patient, I wouldn't have gotten hurt, and I would still be in gymnastics, @CAPS6 then on, I've known that being patient is the right thing to do.\"\n",

Tu va ou pas? On a +¬tude cette class-l+á. Tu peux aller au bibliotheque si tu veux....\" @CAPS3 all blinked at me, @PERSON1, @NUM1le and @ORGANIZATION1, chocolate-haired and mocha skinned, impatiently awaiting my answer. The truth was, I knew @CAPS3 didn't really care if I came or not. It made no difference to them if I trailed a few feet behind like some pathetic puppy. I was silent but adorable, loved only because I was an @CAPS4. Because I spoke fidgety @CAPS5. Because I was the exchange student, because my translator and colorful clothes were so shocking for ten seconds, and were then forgotten about.  I was a flock of seagulls haircut. So why are you here? I thought. Why did you go on exchange at all? You are the complete opposite of everyone here. No one wants you. Just go home.  But my ego had a ready answer. You begged for this remember? For months and months, it was all you wanted, all you thought about, all you dreamt about. So I went with the girls. As expected, @CAPS3 walked down the three-person wide staircase side-by-side, and I shuffled awkwardly behind them. Finally arriving at @NUM2scalier, we sat at a table, the three girls talking. I glazed my eyes over, attempting to look lost in thought, as if I didn't care I wasn't included. Selfish thoughts buzzed in my head; if @CAPS3 weren't talking to me, why should I make the effort to talk to them?   I really had no idea how @CAPS3 felt about me. How does someone feel about their shadow? @CAPS3 notice it, sure, but it never offers up insight, it never makes you laugh. It's all in the confidence, said my mother's voice, all how you carry yourself. But I knew it wasn't that simple. I was just too alien. These girls would never understand me, as I would never understand them. In frustration, I started to flick peas across the room with my spoon. Pat, flick, sproing.  This caught the interest of @PERSON1, as @NUM1le and @ORGANIZATION1 were discussing something very emotional. Tears began to pour out of @ORGANIZATION1's eyes. Sniffling, she and @NUM1le went to the bathroom, leaving me all alone with @PERSON1. Only @PERSON2 could have felt my felt my same emotion as he stared up at @CAPS6. Silently, I continued shooting peas. @PERSON1 just stared at them as @CAPS3 darted around the room. Suddenly, with a horrible miscalculation, a pea hit a boy in the face. And then, he turned around and swore. And then, @PERSON1 and I looked at each other from across the table.  And then, we laughed.  We laughed so hard I cried. So hard that huge, alien tears flooded from my eyes. People around us were laughing too, even though @CAPS3 had no idea what was so funny. I didn't even know what was so funny. But it didn't matter, because we were dripping tears and snot, reaching for each other, reenacting the pea hitting the boy's face. It was as if we had been friends for years, and laughing happened all the time. It was saturated with all the angst and lonliness and despair I had felt the past four weeks. The connection we felt was instantaneous, like lightening, the kind of connection I felt with my best friends back home. I felt that huge swelling sensation in my chest, like a balloon was stuck inside. My stomach was aching and my cheeks were so sore I felt them seizing up. My heart felt whole even for that second. My soul was open. It was the best laugh of my life.  Sniffle sniffle. GASP. Laughter. GASP. Swipe of tears. Sniffle sniffle. Laughter. GASP. This is why. I thought. This is why you came.

            "                          Laughing is the key of happiness. Is a moment that is remember by many people. You share many laughs with friends, family and sometimes strangers. When you laugh with someone it shows that you have something in common; you both think something is funny and it could build a strong relationship. For me laughing means a lot, i laugh everyday. I will not forget the time when i was really mad at my dad and then laughter fixed the problem. One night me and my dad were in my house in the kitchen and he was arguing with me about my grades. I told him I could still fix them that there was a solution. He was calling me a liar, and more anger kept on building up. He was so hard headed and I couldn't get through his thoughts. He was saying that i could not fixed what i have done: whats done is done. I was getting really mad, I wanted him to go away and i thought i was not ever going to talk to him. We had a lack of trust and i just wanted to tell him he was wrong. I knew he would have got more mad and we were gonna end up screaming at each other. It got me so mad that he couldn't listen. My dad said he wanted the best from me, and he was disappointed. I got really sad because my dad was the kind of guy that was all ways telling jokes and teasing everyone. He always made my day by making me laugh. Usually when he would get me in trouble, it would end up with a joke at the end. The jokes he made when i was sad or mad would build our relationship stronger; we would always end up laughing. Later the night we were with all my family cutting my niece's cake and me and my dad were not talking. As we were singing happy birthday i would glare at him and look down. He was looking at me as if he was all tough. Then we were all saying \"-í@CAPS1 le sople!\", which means blow out the candles in @CAPS2. All of the sudden my uncle blows out the candle on accident and me and my dad stared at each other and laughed so hard. We were crying of laughter and we couldn't stop laughing. It felt great laughing at the same thing and sharing a moment together and putting aside our anger. My dad would try not to laugh but the more he tried the louder his laugh was. It was only me and him who stayed laughing, everyone else giggled. As it was making my dad and my relationship better it build a connection between my family and I. Its a memory that's gonna last a life time, yet it was an important part of my dad and my relationship. Although he was still upset about my grades it was all better. There was a connection between us and we could still look back and laugh about it. I don't know what it was about the night that i found the incident so funny. As it was making my relationship stronger, the distance between me and him didn't matter it was all build up on the memory. Something me and him both share, building a part of him and a part of me. Our problem wasn't fixed but it was as if it was not important, as if laughing made you change and helped us put it aside. Every laughing moment we have now is something me and him share, its now a connection. We both can laugh about the same things and share our thoughts making us stronger. Telling me that while me and him laugh about things is just putting more the negatives away and giving life more meaning. When you know you're happy is when you have a sense of humor. Also when you have those moments with others that you will never forget. The moment when you made laughing an important part of your pass. When all those funny moments become important because that's when you showed you were happy. Its even better when you laugh most of the time because your memories will be all remembered as a happy moment. I know at times i will have moments where i am not laughing, but the key is to always look at the bright side. Even though me and my dad were mad at each other its a memory that will carry on with me forever.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
